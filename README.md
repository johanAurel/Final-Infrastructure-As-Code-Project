The steps our team is taking are as follows:

-Creating an Infrastructure comprising of a vpc and 3 private and public subnets, an internet gateway a nat gateway and its different security groups.

-Building and applying the backend and front end images and deploying them in their various containers using ECRs.

-Use Jenkins CI/CD to continuously deploy and integrate the services onto our cluster.

-Making use of prometheus to monitor our cluster and its constituent services.

-Add an SES in case our tresholds are exceeded.
